* ~[HIGH] there is an implicit conversion to radians or degrees that i do not understand (* pi/180). check actual data units ~
   DONE: original functions were in radians. my data are in degrees so i moved the deg->rad and rad->deg conversion inside functions
* [HIGH] improve string/number parsing, as is there are a lot of issues, the user needs to be carefull when typing the data
* [LOW] rename actual conversion functions to sth more understandable
* [LOW] convert test to gtest or sth
